# Teensy_MIDI-to-CV
This is MIDI to CV interface designed for eurorack synthesizers. It is based on the Teensy LC board and uses the internal DAC and PWM peripherals to output analogue voltages.
The code includes two classes, ADSR and PitchCV which implement the various functions like note glide etc. This makes it easily adjustable to different boards and types of DAC peripherals and timers.
